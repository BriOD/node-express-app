This is a poker tournament record application. It keeps track of the buy-in, venue, date, and most importantly a copy of the receipt. This becomes very useful when it comes time to file taxes.

### Technical Specs

The client of this app was built using ReactJS. The backend was built using Node and ExpressJS. It uses a MongoDB to store all the data.

The frontend was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It uses custom CSS Grid for the styling.
