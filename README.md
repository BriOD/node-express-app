### Overview

This is a poker tournament record application. It keeps track of the buy-in, venue, date, and most importantly a copy of the receipt. This becomes very useful when it comes time to file taxes.

### Technical Specs

The client of this app was built using ReactJS. The backend was built using Node and ExpressJS. It uses a MongoDB to store all the data.

The frontend was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It uses custom CSS Grid for the styling.

### Usage

To use this app, clone down the directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:BriOD/node-express-app.git
```
Change into the project's directory:
```
cd node-express-app
```
Then run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
The app will then open up in your browser. You will then have to create an account using your Gmail credentials. You will automatically be taken through the Google OAuth flow. After that you will have the ability to create new records, and view all your records.
